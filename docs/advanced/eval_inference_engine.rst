Fuzzy Relational Inference Engine
=================================

In the :ref:`inference-label` section, we introduced a high-level interface for the underlying inference engine that
does only minimal work to provide more performance (e.g., it does not construct neural networks).
To complement this type of inference engine, PyNeuraLogic also provides an evaluation inference engine that, on top of
finding all valid substitutions, runs an evaluation of the provided logic program.

Finding the Shortest Path
#########################

As an example of a possible use case of the evaluation inference engine, we will take a look at the example from :ref:`inference-label` but
with a slight twist - we introduce weights to connections, representing either distance from stations in time or some unit of length.

The encoding is almost the same, except for added values to each connection, that is :code:`connected(From, To, Line)[Distance]`.

.. code-block:: Python

    from neuralogic.core import Template, R, V, T, Metadata, Aggregation, Transformation, Combination
    from neuralogic.inference.evaluation_inference_engine import EvaluationInferenceEngine


    template = Template()
    template += [
        R.connected(T.bond_street, T.oxford_circus, T.central)[7],
        R.connected(T.oxford_circus, T.tottenham_court_road, T.central)[9],
        R.connected(T.bond_street, T.green_park, T.jubilee)[14],
        R.connected(T.green_park, T.charing_cross, T.jubilee)[21],
        R.connected(T.green_park, T.piccadilly_circus, T.piccadilly)[8],
        R.connected(T.piccadilly_circus, T.leicester_square, T.piccadilly)[6],
        R.connected(T.green_park, T.oxford_circus, T.victoria)[15],
        R.connected(T.oxford_circus, T.piccadilly_circus, T.bakerloo)[12],
        R.connected(T.piccadilly_circus, T.charing_cross, T.bakerloo)[11],
        R.connected(T.tottenham_court_road, T.leicester_square, T.northern)[8],
        R.connected(T.leicester_square, T.charing_cross, T.northern)[7],
    ]

We have defined two rules called :code:`shortest_path`. The first rule aggregates connected stations and takes all connections' maximum value (distance).
The second rule handles instances when stations are not directly connected - at least one station has to be traversed
to get to the goal station. The second rule aggregates all possible instances and finds maximum value while "calling" one of the two rules recursively.

.. code-block:: Python

    metadata = Metadata(aggregation=Aggregation.MIN, transformation=Transformation.IDENTITY)

    template += (R.shortest(V.X, V.Y) <= R.connected(V.X, V.Y, V.L)) | metadata
    template += (R.shortest(V.X, V.Y) <= (R.connected(V.X, V.Z, V.L), R.shortest_path(V.Z, V.Y))) | metadata


.. attention::

    Notice we are appending metadata with aggregation (Min) and transformation (Identity) functions.


It is also necessary to set additional transformation functions to identity.

.. code-block:: Python

    template += R.shortest_path / 2 | Metadata(combination=Combination.MIN, transformation=Transformation.IDENTITY)
    template += R.connected / 3 | Metadata(transformation=Transformation.IDENTITY)


Evaluating Queries
******************

Now when the template and the knowledge base are ready, we can run queries the same way as for the previously introduced instance of :code:`InferenceEngine`.
The only difference in the interface for :code:`EvaluationInferenceEngine` are returned values from the generator -
instead of returning generator of dictionaries containing substitutions, :code:`EvaluationInferenceEngine` returns a generator of tuple containing the output of evaluation and the dictionary of substitutions.


We can, for example, get the shortest path from the Bond Street station to the Charing Cross station.

.. code-block:: Python

    engine = EvaluationInferenceEngine(template)

    result = engine.q(R.shortest_path(T.bond_street, T.charing_cross)

    print(list(result))

.. code-block::

    [
        (30.0, {})
    ]


The query computed the distance to be :code:`30` units, which is the actual shortest distance for this input. But this query does not bring any additional value compared to evaluation via evaluators or directly on the model.

To fully utilize the fuzzy relational inference engine, we would also want to get some substitutions. For example, we can get the shortest distances from the Green Park station to all reachable stations.

.. code-block:: Python

    result = engine.q(R.shortest_path(T.green_park, V.X))

    print(list(result))

.. code-block::

    [
        (19.0, {'X': 'charing_cross'}),
        (14.0, {'X': 'leicester_square'}),
        (8.0, {'X': 'piccadilly_circus'}),
        (15.0, {'X': 'oxford_circus'}),
        (24.0, {'X': 'tottenham_court_road'})
    ]

This output then tells us that the shortest path to the Charing Cross station from the Green Park station is :code:`19` units long, to the Leicester Square station it is :code:`14` units long, and so on.
